We'll send our linuxpractices folder from linux machine to 
github remote repository. In order to send this folder, 
we have to initialize the git on the LinuxPractices folder. 
We should use git add command for adding the files we want on a git 
staging area. Staging area is still on our local device,
 but we can say that git staging is in between remote and local.
 Before we sent all the codes in a github remote repository, 
we should include a message to the files  so that we can know the
 purpose of the files.
Then we can create a main branch on the github, then add our 
credentials, and send it. 
Git status will help us to see what files can be added to next 
commit. or which files are different and can be pushed to github.
